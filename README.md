NBIA: One of the largest online CT image repositories is the National Biomedical Image Archive (NBIA) hosted by the National Cancer Institute. NBIA is a searchable repository of in vivo images that provides the biomedical research community, industry, and academia with access to image archives to be used in the development and validation of analytical software tools that support: Lesion detection and classification, Accelerated diagnostic imaging decision, Quantitative imaging assessment of drug response.

TCIA:The Cancer Imaging Archive
The biggest public data sharing web platform. A lot of Radiomics datasets are available on this site. For example, the LIDC-IDRI even contains segmentation and annotations, nodule size, nodule counts, patient diagnosis data. But many other datasets only provide image data.
